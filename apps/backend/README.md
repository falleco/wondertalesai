microservice template
===
This is a template project for creating microservices for Sophon. This has the basic setup required to get everything 
running in a local development environment & start building the micro-service.

This is a stripped down [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) project, with [TypeORM](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/sql-typeorm), [Redis](https://github.com/redis/ioredis) configured out of the box.
